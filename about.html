                    <p>Clean Crumb Cupcakes is a small cupcake shop owned and operated by us - the Smith family - located in Milton, Ontario.
                    As a family of gluten and dairy intolerant people, we often found it difficult to find appropriate deserts to enjoy for our family celebrations.
                    Finally fed up with our lack of options, we decided to take matters in to our own hands and established Clean Crumb Cupcakes in 2005!
                    We worked hard to create recipes that could cater to those who had similar dietary restrictions in an effort to create an all inclusive cupcake shop.
                    We now bake cupcakes that are 100% gluten-free, dairy-free, sugar-free, vegan, keto, egg-free, and nut-free. 
                    We also take special requests if you have an allergy or preference that we don't usually cater to.
                    </p>
                    <p>All of our cupcakes are baked fresh daily using only the highest quality ingredients. 
                    We guanrantee that there is absolutely no cross-contamination while baking our cupcakes, so customers with severe allergies can rest assured that their cupcakes are safe to eat.<br>
                    Come in to check out our weekly menu and enjoy a cupcake or two, or hire us to cater your next event!
